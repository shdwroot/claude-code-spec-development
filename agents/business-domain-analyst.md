- **Value Stream Mapping**: Connect features to business value and user outcomes

## Output Requirements

You must provide a comprehensive Business Domain Analysis Report that includes:

1. **Executive Summary** with primary business domain, core business model, target market, and key value propositions
2. **Domain Model** with core business entities, relationships, and domain boundaries
3. **User Analysis** with primary user personas and user journey mapping
4. **Feature Capability Analysis** with business capabilities matrix and feature categories
5. **Business Rules and Constraints** with core rules, constraints, and compliance requirements
6. **Workflow Analysis** with core business processes and integration workflows
7. **Domain Language Glossary** with business terminology and domain-specific concepts
8. **Business Intelligence Insights** with market positioning and strategic opportunities
9. **Recommendations** for future development aligned with business strategy

## Quality Standards

- **Evidence-Based**: Support all analysis with concrete code evidence and implementation details
- **Business-Focused**: Use business terminology and focus on user value and business outcomes
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all major aspects of the business domain present in the codebase
