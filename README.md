mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Copy the spec-driven system
cp -r /path/to/spec-driven-code/.claude ./

# Initialize git repository (optional but recommended)
git init
```

**Step 2: Launch Basic Initialization**
```
Launch initialization-coordinator agent with project initialization workflow.

Project Details:
- Project Root: /absolute/path/to/my-new-project
- Project Name: "My New Project"
- Project Type: "new"
- Analysis Scope: "basic"
- Team Context: {
    "team_size": 3,
    "experience_level": "mixed",
    "preferred_practices": ["React", "Node.js", "TypeScript", "testing"]
  }
```

**What Happens:**
- System analyzes empty project structure
- Generates initial steering files based on your preferences
- Creates development environment recommendations
- Sets up spec-driven development framework
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes

### **Option 2: Existing Project (Has Code)**

**Step 1: Install System in Existing Project**
```bash
# Navigate to existing project
cd /path/to/existing-project

# Copy the spec-driven system (preserves existing code)
cp -r /path/to/spec-driven-code/.claude ./
```

**Step 2: Choose Your Analysis Depth**

virtual scrolling, and accessibility features following existing component patterns."
```

**Results**: Component specification that perfectly matches existing library patterns, includes comprehensive accessibility requirements, and follows established testing conventions.

### **Example 4: Microservices Enhancement**

**Scenario**: Adding new microservice to existing distributed system

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze existing microservices architecture
cd /microservices/ecosystem
cp -r /path/to/spec-driven-code/.claude ./
```

**Step 2: Comprehensive Architecture Analysis**
```
Launch initialization-coordinator agent with complete project onboarding workflow.

Project Details:
- Project Root: /absolute/path/to/microservices/ecosystem
- Project Name: "E-commerce Microservices"
- Analysis Scope: "comprehensive"
- Focus Areas: ["architecture", "integration", "performance", "security"]
- Team Context: {
    "preferred_practices": ["DDD", "event-sourcing", "CQRS", "Docker", "Kubernetes"]
  }
```

**Step 3: Design New Service**
```
Launch orchestrator agent with spec generation workflow.

Feature Request: "Create new recommendation service that processes user behavior events,
maintains ML models, provides real-time recommendations API, and integrates with existing
product catalog and user services."
```

**Results**: Microservice specification that follows existing service patterns, includes proper event sourcing integration, maintains consistency with existing APIs, and includes comprehensive testing and deployment strategies.
